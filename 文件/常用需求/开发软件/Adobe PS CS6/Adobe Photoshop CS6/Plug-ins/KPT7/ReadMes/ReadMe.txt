1.  Introduction
Welcome to procreate(TM) KPT effects.  This document contains 
important information about installing and using this 
collection of filters.  Please review the system requirements 
and installation instructions.



2. Mac OS X Notes
We have provided Mac users with both a non-Carbonized 
and a Carbonized collection of filters.  During the installation, 
you will be prompted to choose which collection you would like 
to install, based on the host application you'll be using.

The Carbonized collection (Mac OS X compatible) will work with 
hosts that have been Carbonized and can run natively 
on Mac OS X.  Examples of these hosts are 
Corel(R) PHOTO-PAINT(R) 10, Bryce(R) 5, and 
procreate Painter 7(TM).   

The non-Carbonized collection (Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x compatible) 
will work with hosts that have not been Carbonized and 
that would run in Classic mode on OS X.  Examples of these 
hosts are Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 4.0 - 6.0, Corel PHOTO-PAINT 8, 
Bryce 4, and Corel Painter 6.1.

The KPT effects Carbonized collection will not run in a 
non-carbonized host application.

If you want to use KPT effects in both a Carbonized and a 
non-Carbonized host, you will have to perform separate 
installations.

KPT effects will not function installed on a UNIX partition 
under Mac OS X.

Navigator 4 (or higher) are required to successfully register

5. Installation Instructions

Mac Installation Information:

Power Macintosh
1. Insert the KPT effects CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
2. If a window displaying the contents of the CD-ROM does not open
   automatically, locate and double-click the KPT effects CD-ROM 
   icon to view its contents.
3. Locate the KPT effects folder on the KPT effects CD-ROM, and 
   double-click the KPT effects installer icon to begin installation.
4. The installer prompts you to locate your Plug-ins folder. This 
   folder is likely within the Photoshop application folder, or 
   within the folder of a compatible host such as PHOTO-PAINT, 
   Bryce, or Painter.
5. Click Continue in the main install window.
6. You will be prompted to choose the type of installation, based on 
   the host application that will be running KPT effects. It will 
   default to the OS 8.6 - 9.x compatible host option.  Examples of 
   OS 8.6 - 9.x compatible or Classic hosts are:

      Adobe PhotoShop 4.0 - 6.0 
      Corel PHOTO-PAINT 8
      Bryce 4
      Corel Painter 6.1

   You can also choose the OS X compatible host option if you want to 
   install the filters to a OS X compatible (Carbonized) host. 
   Examples of OS X compatible or Carbonized hosts are:

      Corel PHOTO-PAINT 10
      Bryce 5
      Painter 7

7.  Click Install to complete the installation.

After completing installation, simply run your host application, such 
as Photoshop, Bryce, or Painter, and choose a KPT effects plug-in from 
within the Filter or Effects menu.

MACINTOSH INSTALLATION TIPS
Ensure that your Mac OS is 8.6 or later, and your display is set to a 
minimum of 24-bit (millions of colors). Also ensure that you have no 
open applications, and that there are no applications running in the 
background (this includes anti-virus software, crash monitoring 
software, and system diagnostic software).

RECOMMENDED RAM ALLOCATION
The minimum RAM requirement for KPT effects to run within the host 
application is 32 MB. For normal usage, it is best to allocate 
as much RAM as is available to your host. Some host applications 
exhibit anomalous behaviors in low memory environments. Performance 
can be enhanced by allocating more RAM to the host.

PC Installation Information:
Windows 98, ME, NT4.0 (SP 6), 2000

1. Insert the KPT effects CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
2. If a window displaying the contents of the CD-ROM does not open
   automatically, locate and double-click the KPT effects CD-ROM icon
   to view its contents.
3. In the KPT effects' installer, click  the "Install" option.
   The KPT effects' welcome screen appears.
4. Click the "Browse" option to locate your host application's 
   plug-ins folder.
5. When you have a complete path statement ending with your 
   plug-ins folder, click "OK".
6. Click the "Next" option and follow the instructions on your screen.

After completing installation, simply run your host application, 
such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel PHOTO-PAINT, Bryce, or Painter, 
and choose a KPT effects plug-in from within the Filter or 
Effects menus.

WINDOWS INSTALLATION TIPS
Ensure that your operating system is Windows 98, ME, 2000, NT4.0 SP6 
(KPT effects does not run on Win 3.x or NT 3.x.x and Windows 95 is
not a supported operating system), and that your display is set to 
a minimum of 24-bit color (true color).

Also ensure that:

* you are using a Pentium or Pentium class processor (KPT effects 
  does not run on an i486(TM)), 
* you have no open applications, and that there are no applications 
  running in the background (this includes anti-virus software, crash 
  monitoring software, and system diagnostic software).



6.  Known Issues

Applying filters to selections:  Host applications based on the Adobe 
Photoshop 3 plug-in specification, such as Corel Painter, can't apply 
a filter outside of a selection.  If you try to do so within 
Photoshop 3, Corel Painter, or other such hosts, you will notice that 
the preview is incorrect, and that artifacts might appear on the final
image. Photoshop 4 or later (or compatible hosts) do not yield these 
results.

All filters
Preview Options:  If your source image has no alpha channel, you may
not be able to see the different previewing options (black, white,
checkerboard, dark checkerboard, etc.).

When your taskbar is at the top of the screen, and you reduce and 
then expand your workspace to full screen, the presets, cancel, and 
accept buttons are partially cut off at the bottom of the screen.

The help files may not launch in Mac OS 9.2 with Adobe Acrobat 
Reader 4.0 installed.  You will have to locate them in the
...\KPT effects\metaos\User Guide folder.

Presets are meant to be used as a starting point.  When you choose
a preset, it will overwrite any existing work you've created in 
your session.

KPT FraxFlame II(TM)
If the flame fractal in the parent window of the Mutation panel is
not the same as the fractal in the Preview window and you can't get
it to update, set the Genetic Variation slider (on the Mutation 
panel) to 0, so that all of the smaller surrounding fractals take 
on the shape of the parent fractal.  Click one of the surrounding
fractals to update (regenerate) the parent, and the Preview
window will refresh.

KPT Fluid(TM)
Fluid will not transfer the image back to Photoshop 4.0 
if you are in Mac OS 9.2.

KPT Gradient Lab(TM)
Gradient blending:  When applying the Hue map blend mode to a 
JPEG source image, you may not get a good result due to the quality
of the JPEG format.

Presets in the Gradients folder (Category 1, Category 2, Category 3, 
Category 4) are color blend presets and can be imported through the 
Gradient panel (arrow in top right corner).  Presets in the Gradient 
Lab folder store the layer and slider information all of the panels 
within the filter.

KPT Lightning
There may be slight differences between the thumbnail in the 
Preset Manager and what gets displayed in the Preview window.

KPT Scatter(TM)
Particle panel:  Alt + click to remove particles.

If you get an error message when trying to import a particle from
the ...\KPT effects\Samples\Particles folder, go up one folder 
level and then back down to the Particles folder.

Corel PHOTO-PAINT 8 and 10 (Mac) may not load particles if 
the preview for the thumbnail is on -- allocate more RAM to 
the host.

The best particle results are achieved from files with a 
transparent background and a modest file size.



7.  Other

Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 and Apple Quick Time 5.0 are included on 
the CD for your convenience.  They are located in a folder called 
"Utilities", off the root of the CD.

We have also included over 100 extra particles for you to Scatter 
across your source images. They are located in a folder called 
"More Particles", off the root of the CD.
